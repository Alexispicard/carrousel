# carrousel

Several issues:

#1: on the first view controller the scrollview does not move on the simulator and I can't figure out why

#2: on the sign in view controller, I am not sure I have created the scroll and the images in the right order.

#3: I have a bug that I can't even really describe, there is no error message. 

#4: I can't test the methods (?) I'm tyring to use because of the bug above:
  scrollView.contentOffset.y = // max offset
  button.transfrom = CGAffineTransformMakeTranslation( x, y)
  
  Can you maybe look in the code if that looks right? I'm not so sure even to begin.


Thanks

Alexis
